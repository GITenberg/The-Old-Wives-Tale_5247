description: "The Old Wives' Tale is a novel by Arnold Bennett, first published in\
  \ 1908. It deals with the lives of two very different sisters, Constance and Sophia\
  \ Baines, following their stories from their youth, working in their mother's draper's\
  \ shop, into old age. It is generally regarded as one of Bennett's finest works.\
  \ It covers a period of about 70 years from roughly 1840 to 1905, and is set in\
  \ Burslem and Paris.\nBennett was initially inspired to write the book by a chance\
  \ encounter in a Parisian restaurant. In the introduction to the book, he says\n\
  \n...an old woman came into the restaurant to\ndine. She was fat, shapeless, ugly,\
  \ and grotesque. She had a ridiculous voice, and ridiculous gestures. It was easy\
  \ to see that she lived alone, and that in the long lapse of years she had developed\
  \ the kind of peculiarity which induces guffaws among the thoughtless.\n\nand\n\n\
  I reflected, concerning the grotesque diner: \"This woman was once\nyoung, slim,\
  \ perhaps beautiful; certainly free from these ridiculous mannerisms. Very probably\
  \ she is unconscious of her singularities. Her case is a tragedy. One ought to be\
  \ able to make a heartrending novel out of the history of a woman such as she.\"\
  \ Every stout, ageing woman is not grotesque—far from it!—but there is an extreme\
  \ pathos in the mere fact that every stout ageing woman was once a young girl with\
  \ the unique charm of youth in her form and movements and in her mind. And the fact\
  \ that the change from the young girl to the stout ageing woman is made up of an\
  \ infinite number of infinitesimal changes, each unperceived by her, only intensifies\
  \ the pathos.\n\nBennett also found inspiration in Maupassant's novel Une Vie. [1]\n\
